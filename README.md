# StdLib
An Ada library mirroring the structure and functionality of the Golang standard library.

This project is not affiliated in any way with Google or go.dev.

Wilst Adas naming and readability is highly appreciated. This project is not intended to 
utilise the usual Ada style but rather be close to the idiomatic Go style, thereby inheriting 
the fairly extensive Go documentation and examples.

The intention is to provide a clear and useful functionally tried and tested resource for 
Adaists that will work with any runtime.

Any code which requires a particular runtime will only be located within the folder ravenscar_plus.
