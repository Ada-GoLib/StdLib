# StdLib
An Ada library mirroring the structure and functionality of the Golang standard library.

This project is not affiliated in any way with Google or go.dev.

Whilst Adas naming and readability is highly appreciated. This project is not intended to  
utilise the usual Ada style but rather be close to the idiomatic Go style, thereby leveraging  
the fairly extensive Go documentation and examples.

The intention is to provide a clear and useful functionally tried and tested resource for  
Adaists that will work with any runtime. Whilst also providing a learning resource.

The code in this repository ia also inetended in some case to depend upon and serve as a form  
of documentation for the GNAT standard library.

Any code which requires a particular runtime will only be located within the folder ravenscar_plus.
