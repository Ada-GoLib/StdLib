# StdLib
An Ada library mirroring the structure and functionality of the Golang standard library.

This project is not affiliated in any way with Google or go.dev.

Whilst Adas naming and readability is highly appreciated. This project is not intended to  
utilise the usual Ada style but rather the idiomatic Go style, thereby leveraging the  
fairly extensive Go documentation and examples.

The intention is to provide a clear and useful functionally tried and tested resource for  
Adaists that will work with any runtime. Whilst also providing a learning resource for  
Adaists and even Gophers who wish to explore Ada or create systems with realtime or  
precise memory requirements.

The code in this repository is also intended to depend upon and serve as a form of  
documentation for the GNAT standard library whose code is GPL3 with the GCC runtime  
library exception.

Any code which requires a particular runtime will only be located within the folder  
src/ravenscar_plus. 

Please feel free to contribute.
